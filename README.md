 base on eos side chain
As the parallel chain of EOS main chain, EOCS Chain uses EOSIO software as the underlying infrastructure of blockchain, and still maintains the same BFT-DPOS consensus mechanism and blockchain data structure. Therefore, we call it a cross-chain between the EOS main chain and the isomorphic chain. EOCS Chain will realize the transmission, parsing and processing of isomorphic cross-chain protocol packets by writing EOSIO system plug-ins and smart contracts while maintaining the independence of EOS main chain and EOS Chain
